						CLIENT - How much will it cost to do this job?
						<br>CONTRACTOR - $2,800 dollars.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - That's too expensive for this job!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - How much do you think it should cost?
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - $800 max! It's a simple job!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I can't do the job for so little.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - People in your line of work wants to make a huge profit!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I'm sorry you feel this way. Why don't you do the job?
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - But, but, I don't know how to do any of that.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - For $900, I can teach you everything you need to know to do the job. You can then use $800 to do the job, and you're still saving $1,100. Also, you will obtain all the knowledge and the experience for the next time you need to do this job.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - Deal!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Great! To start, you need to buy tools. You will need a chipping hammer, a nail gun, a laser, a drill, a mixer machine, PPE, and some other things.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - But, I don't have any of those tools and I can't buy all that for just one job!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Ok. I can rent you my tools for another $300. You're still saving $800.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - That's cutting my savings, but I will rent your tools.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Perfect! I'll be back Saturday and we can start.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - Wait! I can't Saturday. I only have time today.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I'm sorry, I only teach others on Saturdays. I have to prioritize my time and my tools needs to be in other jobs I have during the week.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - Ok then. I will sacrifice my family's plans on Saturday.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Right, me too! Oh, I forgot. If you're going to do the job yourself, you need to buy the materials. There's a high demand nowadays, so your best bet is to get a truck and be at the hardware store by 6am before other <br>CONTRACTORs get there.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - AT SIX IN THE MORNING? On Saturday? That's too early for me. I don't even have a truck!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I guess you'll have to rent one. By the way, do you have some helpers to help you load the truck?
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - You know what? I've been thinking. Probably is better for you to do the job. It's better to pay you to do the job right and not having to go through all that hassle.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Good thinking. Sign here and let me get to work.
						<br><br><br>
						This is the truth.

						People are not just paying for a job, they are paying for knowledge, experience, tools, time, family sacrifices, and other things you bring to the table.

					An old Italian man lived alone in the country. He wanted to dig his tomato garden, but it was very hard work as the ground was hard. His only son, Vincent, who used to help him was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament.
					<br><br><br>
					"Dear Vincent,
					<br><br>
					I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I"m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, I know you would dig the plot for me.
					<br><br>Love, Dad."
					<br><br><br>
					A few days later he received a letter from his son.
					<br><br>
					"Dear Dad,
					Don't dig up that garden. That's where I buried the BODIES.
					<br><br>
					Love, Vinnie."
					<br><br><br>
					At 4 AM the next morning, FBI Agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologised to the old man and left.
					<br><br>
					That same day, the old man received another letter from his son.
					<br><br>
					"Dear Dad,
					<br><br>
					Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances.
					<br><br>
					Love, Vinnie."

					The Master replied the same way.

					On another occasion, a student who's trained for 30 years asked a similar question.

						An Airbus 380 is on its way across the Atlantic. It flies consistently at 800 km/h at 30,000 feet, when suddenly a Eurofighter with a Tempo Mach 2 appears.
						<br><br><br>
						The pilot of the fighter jet slows down, flies alongside the Airbus, and greets the pilot of the passenger plane by radio: "Airbus, boring flight, isn't it? Now have a look here!"
						<br><br><br>
						He rolls his jet on its back, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, and then swoops down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. <br><br>He loops back next to the Airbus and asks: "Well, how was that?"
						<br><br>The Airbus pilot answers: "Very impressive, but watch this!"
						<br><br><br>
						The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly straight, at the same speed. After 15 minutes, the Airbus pilot radios, "Well, how was that?
						<br><br>Confused, the jet pilot asks, "What did you do?"
						<br><br><br>
						The Airbus pilot laughs and says: "I got up, stretched my legs, walked to the back of the aircraft to use the washroom, then got a cup of coffee and a chocolate fudge pastry."

						This is a story about four persons names Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody.
						<br><br>
						There was an important job to be done and Everybody was asked to do it.
						Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it.
						<br><br>
						Somebody got angy about that because it was Everybody's job. Everybody thought that anybody could do it, and Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't do it.
						<br><br>
						It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when actually Nobody blamed Anybody.

					<!-- <br><br><br> -->
					<br><br><br>People look around at each other a few times. Silence all round.
					<br><br>"No takers?" says the Texan.
					<br><br>One person walks out and the Texan orders a pint from the bar-keep (bar tender) to drink by himself.
					<br><br><br>30 minutes later, the guy who walked out comes back in and asks the Texan, "Does your challenge still stand?"
					<br><br>"It sure does!", says the Texan.
					<br><br>"Can I take up your challenge?"
					<br><br>"Yes, 10 pints in two-minutes for $500", says the Texan.
					<br><br><br>The bar-keep takes out the stop-watch. He starts it when he serves the first pint.
					<br><br>The 10th pint was finished with 5 seconds to spare.
					"Here you are. The $500 for beating my challenge", says the Texan.
					<br><br>"By the way," he asks the man.
					<br><br>"Where did you go in the last 30 minutes?"
					<br><br>"I had to find a pub to see if I could do it!", says the man.

					It's good to test yourself with a trial run or prototype before you accept the offer or challenge. The chances are better that way even if you are playing with a spreadsheet or with other people.

					You guessed it. My appreciation of Irish humour started from Tom Millet, an Irishman of course. He was the Comm's Lab Mgr during my thesis time.

					The Lone Ranger and Tonto went camping in the desert.
					After they got their tent all set-up, both fell sound asleep.
					<br><br><br>
					Some hours later, Tonto wakes the Lone Ranger and say, "Kemosabe, look towards the sky, what do you see?"
					<br><br>
					The Lone Ranger replies, "I see millions of stars."
					<br><br>
					"What that tell you?" asked Tonto.
					<br><br>
					The Lone Ranger ponders for a minute and says,
					<br><br>- "Astrologically speaking, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo.
					<br><br>- Timewise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three in the morning.

					- - - STORY - - -<br><br>
					Once upon a time, there was a wise Zen master. People travelled from far away to seek his help. In return, he would teach them and show them the way to enlightenment.
					<br><br><br>
					On this particular day, a scholar came to visit the master for advice. "I have come to ask you to teach me about Zen," the scholar said.
					<br><br><br>
					Soon, it became obvious that the scholar was full of his own opinions and knowledge. He interrupted the master repeatedly with his own stories and failed to listen to what the master had to say. The master calmly suggested that they should have tea.
					<br><br><br>
					So the master poured his guest a cup. The cup was filled, yet he kept pouring until the cup overflowed onto the table, onto the floor, and finally onto the scholar's robes. The scholar cried "Stop! The cup is full already. Can't you see?"
					<br><br><br>
					"Exactly," the Zen master replied with a smile. "You are like this cup - so full of ideas that nothing more will fit in. Come back to me with an empty cup."
					<br><br><br>

					Keni Lee Burgess: 
					<br><br>
					To be able to listen intently, hearing exactly what is being said to you is a skill. Do not listen, while having an internal conversation with yourself as to how to respond.
