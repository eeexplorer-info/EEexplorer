What does blue collar mean?

Blue collar is a term used to refer to people who typically work in jobs that require manual labour, like agriculture, manufacturing, construction or mining.

The term classifies different jobs based on the characteristics of the position and the skill set required to perform it. Other terms used similarly also refer to the characteristics of a position and not necessarily to the uniforms worn. For example, some other terms are purple collar, pink collar and white collar.

Blue collar refers to jobs that are outdoors or require interaction with heavy machinery.

The term originates from the uniforms or work wear worn by manual labourers in the 1920s. They had to be more durable to withstand their work environments, so they typically made it of materials like denim or chambray, which are often blue.
