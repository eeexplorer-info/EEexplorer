"If you're not having fun, you're not learning. There's a pleasure in finding things out."
-- Richard Feynman


"Many people do not understand that physics is not mathematics. And mathematics is not physics. One helps the other."
/ Richard Feynman /



"The truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought."
-- Richard Feynman


"Understand. Don’t memorize. Learn principles, not formulas."
~~ Richard Feynman


"You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.
You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting."
~~ Richard Feynman


"Anytime you try to teach the subjects without teachers who love the subject, it is doomed to failure and is a foolish thing to do."
/ Richard Feynman /


"I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned."
-- Richard Feynman


"Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible."
/ Richard Feynman /

"Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter.

Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.

Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best.
Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do.

Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all."
~~ Richard Feynman



"Understanding is more important than memorization."

And not everyone is an artist."

You have to pay attention."
~~ Richard Feynman

"Richard Phillips Feynman (/'fa?nm?n/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichiro Tomonaga.


Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked the seventh greatest physicist of all time.


He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology..."
