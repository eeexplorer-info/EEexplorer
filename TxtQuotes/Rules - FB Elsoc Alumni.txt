About this group (ELSOC ALUMNI)


A warm welcome to all our UNSW ELSOC Alumni!

We would love to allow for past students to keep in touch with the society, UNSW School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications and with each other, as well as to provide opportunities for alumni and friends to connect.


With over 60 years of operation at the University of New South Wales, the UNSW Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications Society has seen thousands of students graduate into many different areas of EE&T.


We hope this Facebook group is a relevant space where you can gain access to society news, alumni events! As alumni, you are part of a family, the UNSW ELSOC family and it is our desire to keep our connection strong.


Please feel free to add anyone to this group. All UNSW EE&T alumni are welcome!
