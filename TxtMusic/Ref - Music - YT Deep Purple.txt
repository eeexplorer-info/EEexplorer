It doesn't matter how fast he plays, you can hear every single note that Blackmore hits and they're clean and clear.

I love how Gillan just casually strolls up to the microphone, standing like he's just at the pub with his friends chatting, then delivers an incredible vocal line seemingly without even trying. Then pulls out a harmonica for good measure

Funny how 40 years later you look back and can clearly see that Deep Purple were by far the greatest live rock and roll band of all time. With the Stones, The Who, Zeplin, we has so much going on at once it almost marginalized what Deep Purple were doing on stage however when all the smoke cleared and time passed its now so easy to see how heads and shoulders above the crowd Deep Purple was. Fucking awesome, tight, gear changes on a dime, riffs, slashes, beats, vocals, wow....

This Ian Paice Fellow is an Absolute Beast Behind the drum kit.  His movements are extremely and naturally gifted.  It is ridiculous actually, as he moves around the Drum Kit with such Ease it's not even funny!  As a drummer of more then 40 years, myself as well as others drummers will attest to that same statement.  Guys like this simply do not come along very often.  He fits in there right between John Bohnam and Keith Moon, but he's a lefty.  He needs to be acknowledged more then he has historically and that's all there is to it!

One thing about Deep Purple:  They loved playing.  Whenever I heard them, they were always having a good time up there.  They weren't at work, they were lovin every minute.  They had fun on stage and it was contagious.

Only now I noticed how utterly relaxed Gillan is all through the song. He does the announcement, then sort a lays back and grooves for five minutes, sings a couple of verses where he doesn't even get the lyrics exactly right and then gets right back to grooving.  That's a front man for you. No drama, no ego, just chilling out and doing his thing (and how well he does it here). Amazeballs.
