					<summary>HIGH SCHOOL LECTURE</summary>
					<br>
					- - - STORY - - -<br><br>
					Bill Gates was invited by a high school to give a lecture. He arrived by helicopter, took the paper from the pocket where he had written eleven items.<br><br>He read everything in less than 5 minutes, was applauded for more than 10 minutes non-stop, thanked him and left in his helicopter. What was written is very interesting, read:
					<br><br><br>
					1. Life isn't easy — get used to it.
					<br><br><br>
					2. The world is not concerned about your self-esteem. The world expects you to do something useful for it BEFORE you feel good about yourself.
					<br><br><br>
					3. You will not earn $20,000 a month once you leave school. You won't be vice president of a company with a car and phone available until you've managed to buy your own car and phone.
					<br><br><br>
					4. If you find your teacher rude, wait until you have a boss. He will not feel sorry for you.
					<br><br><br>
					5. Selling old newspapers or working while on vacation is not beneath your social standing. Your grandparents have a different word for it: they call it opportunity.
					<br><br><br>
					6. If you fail, it's not your parents' fault. So do not whine about your mistakes, learn from them.
					<br><br><br>
					7. Before you were born, your parents weren't as critical as they are now. They only got that way from paying your bills, washing your clothes and hearing you say they're "ridiculous."
					<br><br>So before saving the planet for the next generation wanting to fix the mistakes of your parent's generation, try cleaning your own room.
					<br><br><br>
					8. Your school may have blurred the distinction between winners and losers, but life isn't like that. In some schools, you don't repeat more than a year and you have as many chances as you need to get it right.
					<br><br>This looks like absolutely NOTHING in real life. If you step on the ball, you're fired… STREET!!! Do it right the first time!
					<br><br><br>
					9. Life is not divided into semesters. You won't always have summers off, and it's unlikely that other employees will help you with your tasks at the end of each term.
					<br><br><br>
					10. Television is NOT real life. In real life, people have to leave the bar or the club and go to work.
					<br><br><br>
					11. Be nice to the CDFs (those students that others think are assholes). There is a high probability that you will work FOR one of them."

						CLIENT - How much will it cost to do this job?
						<br>CONTRACTOR - $2,800 dollars.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - That's too expensive for this job!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - How much do you think it should cost?
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - $800 max! It's a simple job!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I can't do the job for so little.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - People in your line of work wants to make a huge profit!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I'm sorry you feel this way. Why don't you do the job?
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - But, but, I don't know how to do any of that.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - For $900, I can teach you everything you need to know to do the job. You can then use $800 to do the job, and you're still saving $1,100. Also, you will obtain all the knowledge and the experience for the next time you need to do this job.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - Deal!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Great! To start, you need to buy tools. You will need a chipping hammer, a nail gun, a laser, a drill, a mixer machine, PPE, and some other things.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - But, I don't have any of those tools and I can't buy all that for just one job!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Ok. I can rent you my tools for another $300. You're still saving $800.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - That's cutting my savings, but I will rent your tools.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Perfect! I'll be back Saturday and we can start.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - Wait! I can't Saturday. I only have time today.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I'm sorry, I only teach others on Saturdays. I have to prioritize my time and my tools needs to be in other jobs I have during the week.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - Ok then. I will sacrifice my family's plans on Saturday.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Right, me too! Oh, I forgot. If you're going to do the job yourself, you need to buy the materials. There's a high demand nowadays, so your best bet is to get a truck and be at the hardware store by 6am before other <br>CONTRACTORs get there.
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - AT SIX IN THE MORNING? On Saturday? That's too early for me. I don't even have a truck!
						<br>CONTRACTOR - I guess you'll have to rent one. By the way, do you have some helpers to help you load the truck?
						<br><br><br>
						CLIENT - You know what? I've been thinking. Probably is better for you to do the job. It's better to pay you to do the job right and not having to go through all that hassle.
						<br>CONTRACTOR - Good thinking. Sign here and let me get to work.
						<br><br><br>
						This is the truth.

					<summary>ITALIAN'S GARDEN</summary>
					<br>
					- - - STORY - - -<br><br>
					An old Italian man lived alone in the country. He wanted to dig his tomato garden, but it was very hard work as the ground was hard. His only son, Vincent, who used to help him was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament.
					<br><br><br>
					"Dear Vincent,
					<br><br>
					I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I"m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, I know you would dig the plot for me.
					<br><br>Love, Dad."
					<br><br><br>
					A few days later he received a letter from his son.
					<br><br>
					"Dear Dad,
					Don't dig up that garden. That's where I buried the BODIES.
					<br><br>
					Love, Vinnie."
					<br><br><br>
					At 4 AM the next morning, FBI Agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologised to the old man and left.
					<br><br>
					That same day, the old man received another letter from his son.
					<br><br>
					"Dear Dad,
					<br><br>
					Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances.
					<br><br>
					Love, Vinnie."

					Another student, who was with the club for 20 years asked the same question.
					<br><br>
					The Master replied the same way.
					<br><br>
					On another occasion, a student who's trained for 30 years asked a similar question.
					<br><br>
					The Master finally replied, "I show you the secrets every day. It's in the basics."

					An Airbus 380 is on its way across the Atlantic. It flies consistently at 800 km/h at 30,000 feet, when suddenly a Eurofighter with a Tempo Mach 2 appears.
					<br><br><br>
					The pilot of the fighter jet slows down, flies alongside the Airbus, and greets the pilot of the passenger plane by radio: "Airbus, boring flight, isn't it? Now have a look here!"
					<br><br><br>
					He rolls his jet on its back, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, and then swoops down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. <br><br>He loops back next to the Airbus and asks: "Well, how was that?"
					<br><br>The Airbus pilot answers: "Very impressive, but watch this!"
					<br><br><br>
					The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly straight, at the same speed. After 15 minutes, the Airbus pilot radios, "Well, how was that?
					<br><br>Confused, the jet pilot asks, "What did you do?"
					<br><br><br>
					The Airbus pilot laughs and says: "I got up, stretched my legs, walked to the back of the aircraft to use the washroom, then got a cup of coffee and a chocolate fudge pastry."

					Once upon a time, there was a wise Zen master. People travelled from far away to seek his help. In return, he would teach them and show them the way to enlightenment.
					<br><br><br>
					On this particular day, a scholar came to visit the master for advice. "I have come to ask you to teach me about Zen," the scholar said.
					<br><br><br>
					Soon, it became obvious that the scholar was full of his own opinions and knowledge. He interrupted the master repeatedly with his own stories and failed to listen to what the master had to say. The master calmly suggested that they should have tea.
					<br><br><br>
					So the master poured his guest a cup. The cup was filled, yet he kept pouring until the cup overflowed onto the table, onto the floor, and finally onto the scholar's robes. The scholar cried "Stop! The cup is full already. Can't you see?"
					<br><br><br>
					"Exactly," the Zen master replied with a smile. "You are like this cup - so full of ideas that nothing more will fit in. Come back to me with an empty cup."

						<summary>CAR's MID-FLOOR SHAKE</summary>
						<br>This is from Ken Robinson at the RSL after seeing and commenting on my latest community service projects there.<br><br>

						For me, it was easy to recall his story as I had a similar situation with our designed product and external electromagnetic interference on site.<br><br>

						- - - STORY - - -<br><br>
												
						A guy reported to the Ford dealership in Newcastle his new model car always shook when it went over 80 km/hr. He kept saying, "she's a too tight" in his characteristic Italian accent.<br><br>

						Ken, the branch manager, firstly rebalanced all the wheels, the drive train and delivered it back to Bourke with an aim to remove the mid-floor shake. The customer drove it normally and reported, "she's a too tight" after a few days.<br><br>

						Ken recalled the car and stripped it all back himself down to nuts and bolts. It was returned a second time. "She's a too tight" came back over the telephone. "Ok, bring it back and we'll go back to the factory in Brisbane and ask the engineers there to look into it further."<br><br>

						The engineers reported back to Ken that "everything performs well within specifications and torque limits". This was relayed back to the customer in Bourke. The customer still replied with "she's a too tight".<br><br>

						Ken, asked the customer, why he kept saying, "she's a too tight". He replied, "I weld sections together for pipelines. You need space between welds so they can expand and contract in the day and night."<br><br>

						Ken twigged and went to the Brisbane plant to see the robot welding the chassis & panels. Sure enough, the spot welds were closer together than expected on the plans. Three spots in the space of one expected interval.<br><br>

						The welding tip had slipped down and welded three times in the space of one as the job was incrementing along. Naturally, it didn't come up in the performance tests. Ken alerted the engineers with some 'clear and descriptive' words.<br><br>

						The robot was adjusted back to where it should have been welding in the process line.<br><br>

						Ken had his team grind out two of the three extra welds to stop the mid-floor vibration from appearing after 80 km/hr.<br><br>

						The car was delivered back to the customer. The return call came back to say, "She's a good and not a tight anymore. Thank you for following this up."

						<br><br><br>
						- - - TAKE-AWAY - - -<br><br>
						One take-way could be by going back to first principles. For example, interacting with the customer on the frontline by asking a few more questions early on in the conversation. More time and effort could be available for another project.
