About Iron Maiden:
Iron Maiden are an institution. Over the course of 44 years they have come to
embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their
fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following
that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty
determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an
adventure like no other.

The band’s immense discography includes the studio albums ‘The Number Of The
Beast’, ‘Piece Of Mind’, ‘Powerslave, ‘Somewhere In Time’, ‘Seventh Son Of A
Seventh Son’, ‘Fear Of The Dark’, ‘The Final Frontier’ and ‘The Book Of
Souls’which have spawned many classic hits as ‘The Trooper’, ‘Wasted Years’,
‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’, ‘Wasting Love’, ‘Run To The Hills’, ‘Aces High’, ‘Rime
Of The Ancient Mariner’ and ‘2 Minutes to Midnight’.

Lyrics
Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds
All that’s left of what we were it’s what we have become
Once our empires glorious but now the empire’s gone
The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done

Now we are victorious we’ve become our slaves
A land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave

Have you seen the writing on the wall
Have you seen that writing
Can you see the riders on the storm
Can you see them riding ~ can you see them riding

Holding on to jury is that all we ever know
Ignorance our judge and jury all we’ve got to show
From Hollywood to Babylon ~ holy war to kingdom come
On a trail of dust and ashes ~ when the burning sky is done
A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear
The earthquake is a coming but you don’t want to hear
You’re just too blind to see

Have you seen the writing on the wall
Have you seen that writing
Can you see the riders on the storm
Can you see them riding
Can you see them riding. . . Riding next to you

My favorite Iron Maiden record of them all !!!  This iconic artwork is always so reminiscent of the
cityscapes in 'Blade Runner'... I'm sure Derek Riggs must have taken inspiration from the film... Up The
Irons !!!

It's absolutely unbelievable these guys are not yet in the RNR Hall of Fame. As a
rock band they are the epitome of what rock music is, and all that without the
mainstream support of radios and TV. The influence over other metal and rock bands
that are in the aforementioned hall is undeniable.

I am so grateful to my aunt, uncle, and brother for introducing me to metal at a
young age. I grew up with this music in the background at my grandmother's house, in
the car, etc. The big three for them were Maiden, Metallica, and Megadeth, but we
had so much music growing up.

Wow, I haven't listened to this since I was in my 20s (now I'm 58) and I'm stunned by the sound of it, forgot just how good of an album it is, I love that song Quest For Fire.
