There is no one in front of you and there's nobody behind you.
No one is above you; no one is below you.
The circle is sacred because it is designed to create unity.

comes not from growing thicker
in the good years when there is water,
but from staying alive in the bad, dry times.
-- Joseph M. Marshall III

Every life is a circle.
And within every life are smaller circles.
A part of our lives goes full circle every seven  years.
