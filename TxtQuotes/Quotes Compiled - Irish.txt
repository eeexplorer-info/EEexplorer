You've got to do your own growing, no matter how tall your grandfather was.
~~ Irish Proverb


Finn's Irish Bar - Hamilton, Newcastle
{
May you live as long as you want
and never want as long as you live.


May neighbours Respect you,, Trouble neglect you,
The Angels protect you, And Heaven accept you.


A light heart lives long.


May the roof above you never fall in
And those that gather beneath it fall out.
}
