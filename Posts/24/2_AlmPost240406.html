        I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share some sad news with all of you. Unfortunately, we recently learned of the passing of one of our former colleagues, Dr Robert Radzyner. Robert was a Senior Lecturer at UNSW School of Electrical Engineering for many decades, as well as being greatly involved in the Coop Scholarship Program.<br><br>
            
        Robert, known by many as Bob, was a valued member of our school community, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who had the privilege of knowing him. Please see a photo from the archives (Thanks Phil)<br><br>
            
        In honor of Bob's memory, we extend an invitation to those who wish to contribute to consider donating towards purchasing flowers or sharing any thoughts and messages to include in the eulogy by using the link:

He was willing to have a chat when you saw him on campus and very supportive of staff and students. He had remarkable knowledge of Telecommunications and was liked by staff and students."<br><br>

        "Dr. Robert Radzyner's significant contributions to the School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications over the decades have influenced our School and the Telecommunications Group that we have today, and he will be deeply missed."</td></tr>

        <tr><td></td><td>He was an engaged thesis supervisor speaking with others when I was being roadblocked by some empire builders in ElecEng. I sometimes heard, "Can you give me an example of that" when he suspected others had little experience in their expertise.<br><br>

        He was always keen to follow my attempts & triumphs at transporting machine language routines between the Texas Instruments DSP and Motorola systems across the Unix Mainframes (Elec70a, Elec70b & Karri) in the school.<br><br>
            
        Often he suggested an alternative path via others in the building. Doors opened when you mentioned your association with him. The bookcase in his room had a sign, "If you return it, you can borrow it again." He was always "calm like a duck on the surface but paddled frantically underneath" as he said.</td></tr>
