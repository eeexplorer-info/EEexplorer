Understand radio DJs of the 70's were searching for a genre to describe his music, one listener coined the phrase "Laid Back " and it has stuck forever since... I think a whole lot of the magic smoke was involved , and not of the type of smoke that a burst capacitor makes when it goes bad in your Gat amp... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ss0hq5H0l8 is a good watch

I first heard J. J. Cale in the summer of 1970 with his single "Crazy Mamma/ After Midnight". Little did I know that his style would influence MY paying guitar for the rest of my life. The laid back, soft spoken vocals and his signature guitar style is quite unique, I can listen to this all day long, how about you? ??

Despite his influence on musicians such as Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Mark Knopfler and others, singer-songwriter J.J. Cale remains a relative obscurity. In this documentary, Clapton and his idol, Cale, team up for a concert in Dallas. Along the way, director Jorg Bundschuh gives viewers plenty of time to hang with the laid-back architect of the so-called "Tulsa Sound," who penned the rock classics "After Midnight," "Cocaine" and "Call Me the Breeze.

"I'm somewhat prejudiced, since I'm in the film, as the piano player with the Cale Band, but even allowing for that, I still think it's magnificent. If they allowed me to vote even higher than ten, I would. JJ Cale has been an enigma to most of his fans, a mystery, for years. This documentary changes that. The crew from Kick Films really captured the real JJ Cale, not an easy task. I have been playing with Cale off and on since 1957 and the JJ Cale I know is the one you'll see in this film. The DVD has now been released in the USA, on 13 June, 2006 and has been available as a region two DVD in England, Germany and Australia since late 2005. This Documentary is not to be missed!" - Rocky Frisco

Coming back from Vietnam in the 70's, I was introduced to J J Cale (not personally) by a true "flower girl", Jeannie. When my mind was still flashing with visions of explosions and gunfire, my Jeannie brought an aura of peace and tranquility. Smoking pot and laying on the floor of her apartment, speaking softly of dreams and such, we passed the evenings listening to the melodic sounds of J J Cale. Had never heard of J J Cale before Jeannie.

It became a refuge from a world of chaos, Jeannie and I. Long time ago. What a soothing mix of blues, jazz, rock and a little country thrown into the gravy mix. Thank you J J Cale for easing my soul. Thank you Gery Riba for posting this great video-doc. Brought back so many good memories.

He's a classic icon in the music world. Many people out there don't know J.J. Cale and his music or the amount of influence he has had to other great artist like Eric Clapton and the songs that pushed him into stardom like Cocaine and After Midnight etc.  I loved his music for his lyrics just like artist like John Prine who unfortuntely died from Covid-19.  People easily understand and relate to the story lines.

Loved JJ Cale his blues music such a unique way of his own playing the guitar. He and Eric Clapton together was amazing music they had their own musically relationship that was between them only a love for the blues their unique way to play the guitar a friendship love and respect seeing them play together made them both so happy and they did the blues like no other.

J J Cale you will be missed are missed but you have earned your wings in Heaven when you passed 2015 gone but never forgotten your legend lives on your blues friend that you truly loved as a friend Eric Clapton has made sure of that. Wow what a gentle soul you were. U tube Eric Clapton keeps your talent your legend alive.. Your music and legend lives on always with us blues fans. R.I.P. Thank you for all you left with us your blues music to your fans.

JJ Cale was one of the most underrated guitar players/song writers ever. He influenced
many guitar greats like Mark Knopfler and wrote such great songs as Cocaine, After
Midnight, They Call Me The Breeze, The Same Old Blues. A great talent and a great loss.

Excerpt from J J Cale Interview by Max Bell for Classic Rock magazine, 2016-11-11.
Edited by Flip.

(His) album Roll On closes with a song called Bring Down The Curtain, which says: ‘Enough
is enough/Can’t do it no more.’ Is that it? Adios, amigos? “I don’t know. I wouldn’t have
put that on but it is a good ending. Didn’t mean to depress ya. I’m at an age where I am
looking at the end of the clock. Intimations of mortality? I guess. Mind, Willie Nelson
is older an’ me and he’s still going. So don’t take it too literally. I’m not only a
reality writer, I’m a fictitious writer. I like to amaze myself with a cute twist and
turn.”

Perhaps that’s the ultimate self-analysis from an artist who doesn’t do ‘projects’ and
only signs one-off deals. “I don’t ever think I’m making a record,” Cale says. “I just do
it, and when it falls into place, 75 per cent cohesive, I’m always surprised. I listen to
it and think: ‘Is it any good?’ ‘Are the songs any good?’ ‘Is it a concept?’ I don’t have
a clue. It’s just natural evolution. Everything I do is an accident. But it’s my
accident.”

And, he points out. “No one tells me what to do. There’s no one at my door. I’m famous
for Cocaine, Call Me The Breeze and, hell, they might even make After Midnight the
Oklahoma State Song soon. It don’t bug me if that’s all the average guy knows. I don’t
make music most young people would like. Some do. I isn’t no rapper, though I like rap
now they made the lyrics more interesting.”

Suddenly Cale gets a fax confirming the bitter-sweet news that he’s booked to tour
California and beyond. “Oh Lord,” he sighs. “I’d better watch my voice. I’ve got to play
well enough so people don’t throw tomatoes at me. If I’m healthy enough I might even get
on an aeroplane and see you. Maybe.”

These are the guys who helped found rock and roll and that special Nashville sound. And what a duo they made, JJ from Oklahoma and Clapton from the UK, but they made it smooth and easy to listen to. Pure finesse from the best.

He is humble. That’s so true. And that’s what makes him in a class above so many others.
He plays with some of the greatest musicians in the world. And he has so much class. He
can be up front just stealing the show or he seems just as happy to just sit back and
hang with a rhythm and listen. I am heartbroken that J.J. Cale is no longer with us. He
was all about the music. It’s unbelievable if you think about how much J.J. Cale gave to
music.

JJ Cale was an American treasure that too few knew about, unfortunately. He wrote so many
songs made famous by others that it's actually hard to believe. He has a serious case of
"bed-head" here! No glamor issues with JJ; he was the real deal.

From the California shore to New York City
The beat don't never stop
You can hear it on the radio anywhere you go
It's steady as the rhythm of a clock
It cuts through the noise of the city life
It won't seem to go away
It's the devil in disguise I tell you no lies
My fingers do the walking everyday
Yonder comes a young girl she wants to take a whirl
She thinks it's all a dream
She got rock and roll way down in her soul
She wants to know where's the limousine
Get up honey let your mama sit down
You're too young anyway
The devil in disguise give her the prize
Then you can carry her away
When the road I travel starts to unravel
Every which way it goes
The beat starts to press on my bullet proof vest
And my high turns out to be low
Give me my guitar I'm going to go far
Let me see it let me hold it in my hand
I'm the devil in disguise I tell you no lies
I'm playing in a rock 'n roll band
