This was one of my first albums when I was a teenager. Unfortunately I no longer have a record player, but I still have all my albums. I listened to the bat out of hell record over and over. RIP, Meatloaf was a big part of the sound track of my youth. There's never going to be music like the musicians of the 70's and 80's

 It was long ago and it was far away, and it was so much better than it is today. 

Good night Meat Loaf. Rest easy, legend.
