My Happiness Lyrics: 

I see your shadow on the street now
I hear you push through the rusty gate
Click of your heels on the concrete
Waiting for a knock coming way too late
It seems an age since I've seen you
Countdown as the weeks trickle into days
So you come in and put your bags down
I know there's something in the air
How can I do this to you right now
If you're over there when I need you here
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go
It seems an age since I've seen you
Countdown as the weeks trickle into days
I hope that time hasn't changed you
All I really want is for you to stay
So you come in and put your bags down
I know there's something in the air
How can I do this to you right now
If you're over there when I need you here
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go
I know I know I know what is inside
I know I know I know what is inside
I know I know I know what is inside
I know I know I know what is inside
You're over there when I need you here
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go

These Days Lyrics:

It's coming round again
Slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day
This life well it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
It's coming round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
It settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day
Soon enough it comes
Here it is again
Slowly creeping hand
Time and it's command
Soon enough it comes
Settles in it's place
It's shadow in my face
Undignified and lame
This life well it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control well it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Soon enough it comes
Soon enough it comes
Too tie us down
It's coming round again
Slow, slowly creeping hand
This life well it's slipping right through my hand
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control well it's slipping right through my hand
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

Lyrics:
Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
An unhappy life working
Some kind of dead end job
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad
Lean to the side
Whisper it quiet
The end is in sight to working
All night around the clock
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad
But it's not my kind of scene oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side
Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
Move out of sight and onto
Some life I'm dreaming of
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad
So I'll just wait and watch the wheels
While you're turning back
But it's not my kind of scene oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side
Pulls me over and it drags me under
Pulls me over and it drags me under
Alright now alright now

Passenger Lyrics: 

Caged
Hold so tight until your knuckles show
Escape
As far away as you could ever know
You sink them all down
Watch them float up
'til the wheel has spun around
You will
Be bound by what you are
Stand in the corner, with your face stripped of colour
For what?
If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
Step outside and see
Another world
Only if you want to be a passenger
Chained
So many places you'd prefer to be
than framed
By a picket fence and salary
You sink them all down
Then watch them float up
Until the
Wheel has spun around
You will be bound by who you are
tied to the corner
With your
Hope twisted under
In knots
If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
step outside and see another world
Only if you want to be a passenger

Love Your Way Lyrics: 

I got to keep moving to stay warm
Cause I'm freezing in this room
And if I prove no good here
I'll skip to where I should
It's only an imaginary
Vigil that we keep
You salvage what you need
I'll take the love you leave

I love your way
I can't explain
What made me change

I'm wading in deeper ever deeper as I go
I drown the whole idea as I drift away from you
It's only an imaginary vigil that we keep
You salvage what you need I'll take the love you leave

I love your way
I can't explain
What made me change
I love your way

And as the memory gathers dust
Buried in its crust
Are the remains of what we've done
And the seeds of what we just begun
The tapping of the rain
Beats a corrugated drum
And the city glow well it pulses on to the city hum

And as the memory gathers dust
Buried in its crust
Are the remains of what we've done
And the seeds of what we just begun
The tapping of the rain
Beats a corrugated drum
And the city glow well it pulses on 'till the day is done

I love your way
I can't explain
What made me change

Lost And Running Lyrics:

I was sick and tired of waiting lost
You were mad at me for so much more
I was bored listening to the same old chords
You would complain that I was never around
And we shouldn't hope, no we shouldn't hope
If love is so easy then why am I stuck
If life is so smooth why can't I get enough
I'm still lost and running
Everyday moves like a hurricane
That's dragging me around no matter what I say
Night time in the city streets I'm out of luck
The cobblestones are dark and wet there's no one I trust
And it comes around, yeah it comes around
Mr So'Easy say where have you gone
I'm looking for somewhere I can lay down my arms
I'm still Lost and running
I'm taking my time ill let it float away
Spare me no lies and you'll have nothing to say
The further we slip into this rabbit hole
The harder we look for a new place to go
I'm still lost and running

D.A.F Lyrics: 

Holding out for a signal to come
Solution found should appease everyone
Religion hides from developing proof
Believers try to encourage the truth

Cascading down golden rays above
Cascading down life from far beyond
May reveal the silence they deny

Sound and sight end suspicion and fear
Distant light took so long to appear
Fey black eyes mystified everyone

Cascading down golden rays above
Cascading down life from far beyond
May reveal the silence they deny

But they keep filling up, keep filling up my eyes
But they keep filling up, keep filling up my eyes

All Of The Dreamers Lyrics:

From your tower of ivory
I hear you rattle your jewellery
But in a hard bitten irony
You're a, a pillar of the community

When you come down to the barrio
To get a feel for the people’s scenario
It's your grand opportunity
To steal a march on the enemy

Now all of the dreamers
Are jumpin' at shadows in the dark
Follow the leader
Don't follow the leader into the dark

Down in the night it gets so cold
Under the shadow that you've thrown
The disciples stand at dawn
Wait for the world to be reformed
I never promised you the world
I just followed it round as it unfurled
So I string you up and along
With all of the dreamers

So you speak out loud like a libertine
But you're just another cog in the great machine
But in a cold bitter irony
You're a, a hero of the community

When you come down to the barrio
To get a feel for the people's scenario
It's your last opportunity
To steal a march on the enemy

Now all of the dreamers
Are jumpin' at shadows in the dark
Follow the leader
Don't follow the leader into the dark

Down in the night it gets so cold
Under the shadow that you've thrown
The disciples stand at dawn
Wait for the world to be reformed
I never promised you the world
I just followed it round as it unfurled
So I string you up and along
With all of the dreamers
Yeah I string you up and along
With all of the dreamers

All of the dreamers
Ooh
All of the dreamers
