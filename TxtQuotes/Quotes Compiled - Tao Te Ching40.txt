and it has no name.
It is the source and the strength of all things.

if you stay calm,
the world will sort itself out around you.

Lao Tzu said,
"horses haul fertilizer to the fields.
When the world loses touch with Tao,

the less you know.

and everything will turn out
in your favor.

they will never pan out.

The Masters
don't make up their minds.
They turn their thoughts
to other people.

They are good to good people,
and they're good to bad people.
This is real goodness.

They have faith in the faithful,
and they have faith in the unfaithful.
This is real faith.

A Master throws himself
into the world completely,
forgetting everything he's been told.
People pay attention to him
because he lives a life of child-like wonder.
