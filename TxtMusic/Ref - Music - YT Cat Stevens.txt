Lyrics:

Father:
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old but I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

Son:
How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again?
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go
Away, I know I have to go

Father:
It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old but I'm happy

Son:
Away, away, away, I know
I have to make this decision alone - no

Son:
All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,
It�s hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go - away
I know, I have to go

Backing:
I have
To go and make this decision alone - no

Yeah,
I'm close to 70 years old and still teaching at high school. This is one of my
favorites to use in English classes. Like most of Cat Stevens songs, the lyrics
are thoughtful and clearly enunciated. So glad Yusuf didn�t stay silent
after his hyper religious excursion.

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now
They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans
Denim Blue fading up to the sky
And though you want him to last forever
You know he never will
(You know he never will)
And the patches make the goodbye harder still

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven
And though you want to last forever
You know you never will
(You know you never will)
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
Oh very young
What will you leave us this time
