In that time NO VOCALIST could compete with Ian. Dancing, posing, singing, entertaining, playing guitar and flute on a level of his own. And the band worked on the same level. The music, the tricky structure of songs maybe was not really good for air playing. But if you see them now you must confess: they were master class.

If I had been a Medieval king, I would have searched far and wide until I found a bard like Ian Anderson.  He might be the most under appreciated showman we've ever seen.  Unfortunately, I was born a year after this performance, and thus way too late to appreciate Jethro Tull in their prime....but thankfully I had parents who had great taste in music.

Oh man. Every time I hear one of Tull's songs from when I was so much younger takes me back to when there was an unlimited future. Makes me feel for a few minutes that anything is possible. So sad the real world.

Jethro Tull was formed in the late 60's and released their debut album This Was in 1968. Led by charismatic frontman Ian Anderson, they have been touring and recording almost constantly ever since, have registered no.1 albums on both sides of the Atlantic, achieved a succession of gold and platinum discs and won a Grammy award. They remain a massive live draw wherever they play around the world.

In 1970 Jethro Tull played the Isle Of Wight Festival in front of 600,000 people. Earlier that year they had released their third album, Benefit, which had seen the introduction of a full time keyboard player to the band's line up. The set was drawn from across the three albums with popular tracks such as My Sunday Feeling, Dharma For One, Bourée and Nothing Is Easy and also featured My God, a track that would appear on the following year's classic album Aqualung, probably their most famous release.

Nothing Is Easy is a true concert film, combining the classic performances from the festival with a new interview with Ian Anderson, specially shot for the film, and with backstage footage and original interviews from 1970 with Isle of Wight residents and fans attending the festival.

Aqualung by Jethro Tull, live in Golders Green Hippodrome, London, England in February 10, 1977.
The concert was covered live by BBC, and later released on various bootleg DVD versions by fans.
This version is the best quality one, produced by "Room 101".
The strange thing about it is that Ian Anderson's speaks between songs are subtitled in Japanese.

I see a lot of people suggesting that Ian Anderson was "high" on drugs during this show; that's far from true. Anderson is/was only a smoker, he never had any other addictions.

In his own words from 2012, "I didn't drink alcohol, I didn't hang out in bars or pubs, I didn't take drugs, I didn’t do any of the things that were part of the social experience of young musicians at that time".
What you see here is called a PERFORMANCE, including the sniffing at 05:36. The fact that he convinces you only adds to his greatness.

Songs From The Wood & band intro by Jethro Tull, from the DVD "Live At Madison Square Garden 1978", released in 2009 by EMI.
That concert was not videotaped in it's entire, due to BBC limited broadcast duration.
On songs 1-3 and 12-16 you can only listen the band playing while watching a slide show.
Jethro Tull, weirdly, introduce themselves and say goodbye twice that night, due to the aforementioned situation.

Jethro Tull - Life Is A Long Song (Living With The Past)

Tull are a musical powerhouse driven by the distinctive flute and wonderfully crafted melodies of Ian Anderson. Jethro Tull have now performed almost 3000 concerts, featuring a powerful repertoire of classic material sprinkled with the latest gems from a string if vibrant new releases. ‘Living with The Past” is the definitive record of Jethro Tull live. This stunning concert film, captured on the British and Amercian tours in 2001, also features a unique reunion performance by the orginal Jehro Tull line-up which made the every first album back in 1968.

Only Ian has this voice. So distinctive, so wonderful. In a time when there aren't any real standout artists that can be distinguished by their voice or instrumentally it's a soft place to fall. Voice or music, Ian is absolutely unique.

The poetry of this song is beautiful and Anderson's passionate heartfelt delivery utterly authentic and magical invoking the best of Great Britian's agricultural heritage. I love this song for all reasons not least the love and respect Anderson has for the animal itself. Long live the British horse - it'll still be here long after the last tractor has stopped in it's tracks.

Jethro Tull - Banker Bets, Banker Wins (Thick As a Brick - Live in Iceland)

Jethro Tull's famous concept album "Thick As A Brick" was originally released in 1972 and featured one continuous track spread across two sides of an LP telling the story of a young boy called Gerald Bostock.

40 years later in 2012, Jethro Tull's founder and leader Ian Anderson created "Thick As A Brick 2: Whatever Happened To Gerald Bostock?". Following this release Ian Anderson took both albums on the road to perform the complete story of Gerald Bostock and this concert from the tour was filmed in Iceland. The show combines music, video screens and mime to bring Gerald's tale to life as never before and create the definitive presentation of "Thick As A Brick".

TRACKLISTING:
1) Thick As A Brick   2) From A Pebble Thrown   3) Pebbles Instrumental   4) Might Have Beens   5) Upper Sixth Loan Shark   6) Banker Bets, Banker Wins   7) Swing It Far   8) Adrift And Dumbfounded   9) Old School Song   10) Wootton Bassett Town   11) Power And Spirit   12) Give Til It Hurts   13) Cosy Corner   14) Shunt And Shuffle   15) A Change Of Horses   16) Confessional   17) Kismet In Surburbia   18) What-ifs, Maybes And Might-Have-Beens

If someone were to tell me that Ian Anderson was an immortal who had lived through these eras, I'd believe it, no questions asked. Every song he writes is told like a story teller plucked from Medieval times. Even looking in his eyes while he sings this song, it's like he can see the events in front of him. There's never going to be another Ian Anderson

I see a dark sail on the horizon set under a black cloud that hides the sun.
Bring me my broadsword and clear understanding.
Bring me my cross of gold as a talisman.
Get up to the roundhouse on the cliff-top standing.
Take women and children and bed them down.
Bring me my broadsword and clear understanding.
Bring me my cross of gold as a talisman.
Bless with a hard heart those who surround me.
Bless the women and children who firm our hands.
Put our backs to the north wind.
Hold fast by the river.

Sweet memories to drive us on for the motherland.

Jethro Tull - North Sea Oil 1980

Black and viscous - bound to cure blue lethargy
Sugar-plum petroleum for energy
Tightrope-balanced payments need a small reprieve
Oh, please believe we want to be
in North Sea Oil, in North Sea Oil  

New-found wealth sits on the shelf of yesterday
Hot-air balloon - inflation soon will make you pay
Riggers rig and diggers dig their shallow grave
But we'll be saved and what we crave
is North Sea, is North Sea Oil

(Instrumental)

Prices boom in Aberdeen and London Town
Ten more years to lay in fears, erase the frown
Before we are all nuclear - the better way!
Oh, let us pray: we want to stay
in North Sea, in North Sea, in North Sea Oil

Do not be surprised about the close-ups. Coming from the video walls next to the stage, this video is not a standard video recording of a Jethro Tull concert, but these recordings are a priceless contemporary document of one of the most fantastic live bands of our century. so be thankful ... like me ... !!

I can't believe this was captured on film and is on YouTube.
I was there just out of High School at this exact concert.
Ian Anderson walked out under the big screen that no one had ever seen before, and said " Welcome to Tullavision."
The stadium went NUTS!!
I can't believe I can sit in my living room 41 years later and watch, thank you to old technology with professional cameras, and modern with the net.
Great thanks to Tull and the poster that uploaded it.
Unfrigginbelievable!

Best concert I ever saw was JETHRO TULL, and being a teenager in the 60's, I saw almost all of the greats. They put on an energetic show that was second to none while playing all of their albums "Aqualung" and "Thick as a Brick."
After Tull played the whole "Thick as a Brick" album, they left the stage, and the crowd thought the concert was over and clapped wildly for an encore.
When they got back on stage, Anderson announced that they had learned that they could run off stage, empty their bladders and be back on stage in less than five minutes. He then said, "And now, for our second song," and they started playing "Aqualung'." The crowd went wild!!!

The concert was held at the old Atlanta Coliseum, and the theater's stage curtains gave Ian Anderson a place to hide when others in the band took the lead. Plus, the theater's colored lights were perfectly orchestrated with the show. When Anderson wasn't singing or playing the flute, he would run towards the other instrumentalist as if he was conjuring the music out of them.

A couple times, the music went down to nothing, and the lights went to total darkness. When the main spotlight slowly brightened, Ian Anderson would be standing in the middle/front of the stage with his foot on the monitor, melodically playing the acoustic guitar. It was theatrics and music at its finest!
