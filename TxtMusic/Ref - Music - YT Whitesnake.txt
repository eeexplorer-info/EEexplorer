Not keen on the mixes on this album, they dont have the powerful bass line that runs through the original versions. Plus where are their hit singles Give me more time, Dont break my heart again, and Would I lie to you? All big hits of their time. Sweet lady luck was a b-side so shouldn't be on this collection.

Should be called the AM radio version. This is flat, soft and hollow. It loses all the punch and grit of the original. Thanks for posting but I'll pass and stick to the originals.
