Quotes Compiled - Alan Watts

Philosopher (1915 - 1973)


"Life is like music for its own sake. We are living in an eternal now, and when we listen to music we are not listening to the past, we are not listening to the future, we are listening to an expanded present."
-- Alan Watts


"I had a discussion with a great master in Japan, and we were talking about the various people who are wokring to translate the Zen books into English, and he said,
:
"That's a waste of time. If you really understand Zen, you can use the Bible. You could use Alice in Wonderland. You could use the dictionary, because the sound of the rain needs no translation."
/ Alan Watts /
