Story - Texan Challenge


A Texan goes into an Irish pub and says, "I'll give anyone $500 if they can drink 10 pints in two minutes".
:
:
People look around at each other a few times. Silence all round.
"No takers?" says the Texan.
One person walks out and the Texan orders a pint from the bar-keep (bar tender) to drink by himself.
:
:
30 minutes later, the guy who walked out comes back in and asks the Texan, "Does your challenge still stand?"
"It sure does!", says the Texan.
"Can I take up your challenge?"
"Yes, 10 pints in two-minutes for $500", says the Texan.
:
:
The bar-keep takes out the stop-watch. He starts it when he serves the first pint.
The 10th pint was finished with 5 seconds to spare.
:
:
"Here you are. The $500 for beating my challenge", says the Texan.
"By the way," he asks the man.
"Where did you go in the last 30 minutes?"
"I had to find a pub to see if I could do it!", says the man.

Takeaway -- It's good to test yourself with a trial run or prototype before you accept the offer or challenge. The chances are better that way even if you are playing with a spreadsheet or with other people.

You guessed it. My appreciation of Irish humour started from Tom Millet, an Irishman of course. He was the Comm's Lab Mgr during my thesis time.
