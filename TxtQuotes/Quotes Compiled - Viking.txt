17 Viking Sayings That Really Show Norse Wisdom
Melissa Sartore
Updated July 16, 2022


The Scandinavian text the Havmal is part of a 13th-century collection of Old Norse poems. The name of the work translates to "Sayings of the High One," and the contents are presented as the wise words of Odin himself.

The Havmal includes 164 stanzas, all of which provide Viking sayings about how to live, love, play, and fight in the Viking world. Full of practical and philosophical wisdom, it's a fascinating look at Viking Age culture. It's also a handy guide to living a life pleasing to Odin, if you're into that sort of thing.

We've gathered some Viking mottos and Norse wisdom from the Havmal (several translations exist; we combined the most accessible). Take a look and vote up the wisest words Odin had to offer.

then a store of common sense."

The takeaway: When you arrive at a new place, the wisest thing to do is to keep your mouth shut.

work a ship for its gliding, a shield for its shelter,
a sword for its striking, a maid for her kiss;

buy a steed when 'tis lanky, a sword when 'tis rusty;
feed thy horse neath a roof, and thy hound in the yard."
