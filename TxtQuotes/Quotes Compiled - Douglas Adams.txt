{
Here's a recipe for this drink:


** Ingredients: **

- 1 oz of Ol' Janx Spirit
- 2 oz of Santraginean mineral water
- 3 cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin ice
- A slice of lemon
- A large measure of Jynnan Tonnyx
- A sprinkle of Zamphuor
- An olive
- A small paper umbrella
- One used towel (for non-slip safety)


** Instructions: **

1. Fill a glass with the Santraginean mineral water.

2. Add the Ol' Janx Spirit to the glass.

3. Drop in the ice cubes.

4. Squeeze the lemon slice, and carefully drop it into the glass.

5. Mix the Jynnan Tonnyx with the Zamphuor in a separate container.

6. Pour the mixture into the glass. Be sure the liquid is slowly absorbed into the matrializing glass bottom. Beware: this may cause your glass to cease to exist as well.

7. Add the olive and the small paper umbrella for visual appeal.

8. Serve the drink with the used towel to prevent any unfortunate slippage.

9. Say "Froody!" with gusto and enjoy your Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.
