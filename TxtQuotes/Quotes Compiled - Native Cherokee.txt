Cherokee Prayer Blessing
{
May the warm winds of heaven
blow softly upon your house.
May the Great Spirit
bless all who enter there.
May your moccasins
make happy tracks in many snows.
May the rainbow
always touch your shoulder.
}


When you feel powerless,
that's because you stopped
listening to your heart.
That's where the power comes from."
