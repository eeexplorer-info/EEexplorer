Solid and energetic Rock and Roll music during my High School days in the 70's as the Hippy and Vietnam War protest songs were getting some air time as well. Yes, shoulder length hair was the fashion too.

Apart from talent, it has clear signs of teamwork, co-ordination and common purpose.

You're watching Led Zeppelin perform 'Kashmir' live at the Ahmet Ertegun tribute
concert at London's O2 Arena from the concert film 'Celebration Day'
:
:
Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and went on to become one of the most influential,
innovative, and successful groups in modern music, having sold more than 300
million albums worldwide. The band rose from the ashes of The Yardbirds, when
Jimmy Page brought in John Bonham, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant to tour as
The New Yardbirds. In 1969, Led Zeppelin released its self-titled debut which
was produced by Page, as were all the subsequent albums. It marked the beginning
of a 12-year reign, during which the group was widely considered to be the
biggest and most innovative rock band in the world.

And this song is 45 years old. And why are we still listening? Because it's a
masterpiece!

Jimmy Page and Robert Plant in their 70's are way cooler than any modern
musicians today

Dad is smiling down. This is excellent sounding especially since they're
obviously later in years but still so dang solid. This is a when you
grandparents are cooler than the youngsters of this younger generation moment!
Just watch and learn real musical talent at it's best

Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
And stars fill my dream
I'm a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
To sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk in song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
And not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, baby, I been blind
Oh, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin'
Oh, ooh yes, I been blind
Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Try to find, try to find the way I feel
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like sorts inside a dream
Leave the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My shangri la beneath the summer moon
I will return again
As the dust that floats high in June
We're moving through Kashmir
Oh, father of the four winds fill my sails
Cross the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, when I want, when I'm on my way, yeah
And my feet wear my fickle way to stay
Ooh, yeah yeah, oh, yeah yeah,
But I'm down oh, yeah yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, oh, my baby
Let me take you there
Come on, oh let me take you there
Let me take you there

London, July 1968

The band the Yardbirds called it quits, but still was committed to play some shows in Scandinavia, and lead guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist Chris Dreja decided to play them anyway. But they, um.needed a new lead singer and a new drummer. Page's number one choice for singer was Terry Reid, but he turned down the offer, instead suggesting Robert Plant, who had been the singer for Band of Joy.

Band of Joy had broken up a couple months prior. Plant accepted the position and recommended John Bonham, who had been the drummer for Band of Joy, to join the band as well. Page was like 'heck yeah', but then Dreja dropped out of the band to become a photographer so they now needed a new bassist. Fortunately for Page, his old friend John Richard Baldwin, better known by his stage name of John Paul Jones, wanted in and Page gladly welcomed him. He also could play keys, so that was a bonus.

The four played together for the first time in a basement below a record store on Gerrard Street in London. For the Scandinavian tour, they decided to change the band name to the 'wait for it' the New Yardbirds. They played their first show at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on September 7, 1968.

The chemistry between the four was pretty amazing early on. So good that just a few weeks later they were already recording their first album at Olympic Studios based on some new songs they had been playing live. Apparently they recorded it in less than 30 hours, and Page paid for the entire session out of his own pocket. However, once Dreja found out, he issued a cease and desist letter, saying Page wasn't allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the album, only for the tour. That's ok, because Page had a backup name in mind for the band.

Lead Balloon. Eh? Eh? Ok, after further discussion with the band and their new manager, Peter Grant, that name became arguably one of the best band names ever: Led Zeppelin. Led Zeppelin played their first gig with the new name at the University of Surrey in Battersea on October 25.
