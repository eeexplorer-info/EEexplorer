An old cowboy went riding out One dark and windy day Upon a ridge he rested As he went along his way When all at once a mighty herd Of red eyed cows he saw Plowin' through the ragged skies And up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire And their hooves were made of steel Their horns were black and shiny And their hot breath he could feel A bolt of fear went through him As they thundered through the sky For he saw the riders coming hard And he heard their mournful cry

Yippie-yi-o Yippie-yi-yay Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt  Their eyes were blurred  Their shirts all soaked with sweat  He's riding hard to catch that herd  But he ain't caught 'em yet  Cause they've got to ride forever On that range up in the sky On horses snorting fire As they ride on, hear their cry  As the riders loped on by him  He heard one call his name. If you wanna save your soul From hell a-riding on our range. Then, cowboy, change your ways today Or with us you will ride Trying to catch the devil's herd Across these endless skies.  Yippie-yi-o
Sharmini Satgunam !
