Ref - Music - YT Black Sabbath

Guys, Gals and the others in Octal group, (LGBTIQA+),

Solid and energetic Rock and Roll music during my High School days in the 70's as the Hippy and Vietnam War protest songs were getting some air time as well.


Yes, shoulder length hair was the fashion too. Tony Iommi, in the first clip, talks about how Heavy Metal was created. The documentary, in the second clip, made sense when I watched it.

Apart from talent, it has clear signs of teamwork, co-ordination and common purpose.

Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell

[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

[Verse 2]
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

[Verse 3]
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic.

This song tells a really dark story: a man made of iron who comes from the future to save humanity, but they don't give a shit about him so he now wants to get revenge on the very same people he tried to save.
:

People comparing this song to comic book Iron Man is the biggest face palm ever.
This story is about a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic storm. He becomes mute, and due to this he's unable to warn people of his vision of the apocalypse. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes "iron man" to become angry, and drives his revenge on mankind, causing the apocalypse which he sees in his vision.

Headless Cross is one of Black Sabbath's best and most underated albums. It
deserves to be remastered and reissued. Tony Martin is a great vocalist who
deserves far more credit and respect than he is getting. The Eternal Idol and
Headless Cross are absolute musts for any serious Sabbath fan.

I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun
But I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find a distant man a-waving his spoon

I've crossed the ocean, turned every bend
I found the crossing near a golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years and it never bothered me

Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'd tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I've left it behind

Always been my favorite album of there's The entire band is awesome. Tony's
riffs & the way the others added to it . Bill's drumming, Geezers Bass &
Ozzy's vocal melody's. & Geezers lyrics are great also. Very clever & deep.. He's not talked much about as the brilliant lyric writer that he is.

I first bought this album back in 1980 and it blew me away. Definitely one of my favorite Sabbath albums. The remastered is so clear they did a great job I hear things in the recording that I've never been able to hear before. Tony's guitar sounds incredible.
