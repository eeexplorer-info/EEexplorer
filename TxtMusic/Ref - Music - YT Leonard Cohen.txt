Hallelujah (Live at Glastonbury) Lyrics:
I�ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don�t really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, now the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Now maybe, maybe there's a God above
As for me, all I ever learned from love
Is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
But it's not a cry that you hear tonight
No it's not some pilgrim who claims
to have seen the light
It's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, and I've walked this floor
You see, I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
But listen, love is not some kind of victory march
No it's a cold and it�s a very lonely Hallelujah
Hallelujah
  
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
Ah, but now you never show it to me, do you?
I remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove, she was moving too,
Yes, and every single breath that we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
I've told the truth, I did not come all the way
to Glastonbury to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand right here before the Lord of Song
With nothing, nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Hallelujah
[Spoken : Thanks so much friends]

The first Leonard Cohen song I heard was Suzanne in 1968 or 1969 when I was a delegate to 'Anytown' in Arizona in high school.  What an amazing song!  What a poet, songwriter, and composer.  My cousin Eileen in Newfoundland introduced me to a lot of his music and history!  Hallelujah is one of my all-time favorites!
