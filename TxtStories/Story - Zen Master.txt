Story - Zen Master


Once upon a time, there was a wise Zen master. People travelled from far away to seek his help. In return, he would teach them and show them the way to enlightenment.
:
:
On this particular day, a scholar came to visit the master for advice. "I have come to ask you to teach me about Zen," the scholar said.
:
:
Soon, it became obvious that the scholar was full of his own opinions and knowledge. He interrupted the master repeatedly with his own stories and failed to listen to what the master had to say. The master calmly suggested that they should have tea.
:
:
So the master poured his guest a cup. The cup was filled, yet he kept pouring until the cup overflowed onto the table, onto the floor, and finally onto the scholar's robes. The scholar cried "Stop! The cup is full already. Can't you see?"
:
:
"Exactly," the Zen master replied with a smile. "You are like this cup - so full of ideas that nothing more will fit in. Come back to me with an empty cup."

To be able to listen intently, hearing exactly what is being said to you is a skill. Do not listen, while having an internal conversation with yourself as to how to respond.
