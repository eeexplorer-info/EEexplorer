Story - Tonto and Lone Ranger


The Lone Ranger and Tonto went camping in the desert.
After they got their tent all set-up, both fell sound asleep.
:
:
Some hours later, Tonto wakes the Lone Ranger and say, "Kemosabe, look towards the sky, what do you see?"
:
The Lone Ranger replies, "I see millions of stars."
:
"What that tell you?" asked Tonto.
:
The Lone Ranger ponders for a minute and says,
"Astrologically speaking, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo.
+
Timewise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three in the morning.
+
Theologically, the Lord is all-powerful and we are very small and insigniicant.
+
Meterologically, it seems we will have a beautifal day tomorrow.
+
What's it tell you Tonto?"
:
:
"You dummber than buffalo chip. It tell me Someone Stole the Tent!".
