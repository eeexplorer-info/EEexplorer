A classic standup bit from the veteran comic. After 35 years, his timing and delivery were perfect. Watch a master at work...

It was always a pleasure watching Dave Allen on TV in the 70’s.
It was a family event and what a fantastic story teller. 
It great to have YouTube to see him whenever I want.

I absolutely adore Dave Allen. I remember as a young kid sitting down to watch his show with mum,dad and my siblings.  When he was telling his stories, you wouldn’t here a peep out of us kids, as we were held mesmerised on every word, until the punchline and we’d all roar with laughter. Thank you Dave Allen for all your stories and comedy. You will be forever in my heart.

Dave Allen explains the unique nature of Irish humour with some of his own fine story telling.

Back for a performance in Dublin, The City where he was born, Dave Allen talks about the often darkly comical take on life in Ireland.

2Irish humour is a magnificent black humour."

For Dave Allen, Ireland is the only place in the world that really accepts death. He describes the ritual of the wake as a marvellous celebration.

The wake is a joyful occasion.

Dan Allen tells the story of a man arriving in a small town in Ireland following the death of a local woman who was hated by everyone in the town. Unsurprisingly, the tale has a humorous ending.

This episode of ‘The Late Late Show’ was broadcast on 6 October 1979. The presenter is Gay Byrne.
