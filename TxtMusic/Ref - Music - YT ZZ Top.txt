You're watching the official music video for ZZ Top - "Sharp Dressed Man" from the album 'Eliminator'.
:
Lyrics:
Yeah

Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie (Black tie)
I don't need a reason why

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out, I'm gonna do you in

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Uh-huh

Top coat, top hat
And I don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white glove
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Oh, you can't lose with the dress I use
That's right, real fine

My first ZZ Top album. My dad owned it and would let me borrow his stereo and oversized headphones to listen to his collection. Maybe that's why, looking at some comments that says that some hardcore fans that disliked it, I can't see why. Love the energy from that album.

R.I.P. to the longest surviving all original RockNRoll band in history .. And of course most of all, rest in paradise Dusty Hill. What a legacy!

Only ZZ Top can sing about burgers, sleeping bags and concrete and steal and still be a bad ass.

The ultimate "working in your garage" song.
